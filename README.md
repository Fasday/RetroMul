# RetroMul

![RetroMul](https://github.com/HemulGM/RetroMul/blob/main/screen/screen0.png?raw=true)

RetroMul is a multi-system retro game emulator written in Delphi with a FireMonkey interface. It runs games for NES / Famicom, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, SEGA Mega Drive / Genesis, SEGA SG-1000 / SC-3000 / SF-7000, Othello Multivision, SEGA Master System / Mark III, SEGA Game Gear, Super Nintendo, Neo Geo MVS, Neo Geo CD, and the PC Engine / TurboGrafx / SuperGrafx family. The repository also includes RetroTune, a companion music player, and RetromulTerm, a Windows console frontend.

## Features

- Browse a game library in grid or list view with cover art and information from `gamelist.xml`, search by title, filter by system or initial letter, and keep favorites and recently played games. ROM files can also be opened directly or dropped onto the desktop application.
- Assign keyboard keys, controller buttons, axes, and D-pad directions for each system and controller port. View the active bindings in the in-game controls help.
- Play with an Android screen gamepad, including NES / Dendy turbo buttons and six-button SEGA controls.
- Use multiple controllers, NES Four Score, and SNES Multitap in compatible games.
- Pause, reset, save and restore game states with preview images, and keep battery-backed saves. Continue games from saved states in the library.
- Switch to fullscreen, resize the game display, and capture screenshots.
- Configure video filtering, audio, Game Boy palettes and boot ROMs, and system-specific hardware and peripherals. Supported settings can be applied during a game.
- Customize Game Boy / Game Boy Color frame blending, separate monochrome background and sprite palettes, layer visibility, sprite limits, CPU speed (100–400%), and individual sound-channel volume. Game Boy Color also offers LCD color correction. Higher CPU speeds and relaxed sprite limits can change game behavior.
- Use Game Boy / Game Boy Color / Game Boy Advance cartridge rumble and cartridge motion inputs on supported devices; tilt and rotation depend on available device sensors.
- Use supported NES peripherals, including Zapper, Power Pad, Family BASIC and Subor keyboards, Miracle Piano, and the Famicom Data Recorder. Four Score must be disabled when using Zapper, Power Pad or Miracle Piano.
- Use an English, Russian or Portuguese interface, with language selection in settings (or custom).
- Listen to native streaming audio. Supported audio platforms include Windows, Linux, Android, macOS, and iOS.

Compatibility depends on the game's cartridge hardware, protection, and peripherals. Mapper or ROM-set support does not imply complete hardware accuracy or full gameplay compatibility for every game. Save-state formats can change between builds.

## Getting started

Open a ROM directly, or select the library root folder in Settings. The library uses these system subdirectories:

```text
ROMS/
  nes/
  gb/
  gbc/
  gw/
  gba/
  n64/
  megadrive/
  sg1000/
  sc3000/
  sf7000/
  omv/
  sms/
  gg/
  snes/
  neogeo/
  saturn/
  dc/
  neogeocd/
  pcengine/
  sgx/
  pcecd/
```

Place ROMs in the corresponding folders. On desktop, an optional `gamelist.xml` in each system folder supplies titles, descriptions, cover paths, and other metadata; games without metadata use their filenames. On Android, choose the ROM folder through the system folder picker.

Desktop shortcuts during gameplay:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `P` | Pause / resume |
| `R` | Reset |
| `F5` | Save the quick state |
| `F6` | Load the quick state |
| `F8` | Take a screenshot |

These shortcuts are suspended while an emulated NES or Subor keyboard is active.

## Building from source

The main application uses Delphi / RAD Studio and FireMonkey. Its Windows sources currently reference the Delphi 13 platform fixes in the DelphiWinUI3 submodule. Initialize the repository's submodules before building:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Open `RetromulGroup.groupproj` for the project group, or open an individual project:

| Project | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/retromul/RetroMul.dproj` | FireMonkey emulator |
| `apps/retrotune/RetroTune.dproj` | FireMonkey music player |
| `apps/terminal/RetromulTerm.dproj` | Windows console emulator with ASCII video output |

`BuildReleases.ps1` builds and packages RetroMul for Windows 32/64-bit, Linux 64-bit, and Android 32/64-bit. Install and configure the corresponding RAD Studio platform SDKs and toolchains. For example, build only the Windows packages from the repository root:

```powershell
.\BuildReleases.ps1 -Platforms win32,win64
```

## Building a Microsoft Store package

After building the Windows application, run:

```powershell
.\BuildStorePackage.ps1
```

The script packages the existing `Win64 / Release` build as an unsigned MSIX in `releases`, using `MakeAppx.exe` from the Windows SDK. It reads the selected configuration's effective MSBuild properties from `apps/retromul/RetroMul.dproj`: `PF_UWPPackageName`, `PF_UWPPublisher`, `PF_UWPPackageDisplayName`, and `PF_UWPPublisherDisplayName`. Configure those values in RAD Studio using the identities from Partner Center. The script does not modify the project, compile the application, install the package, or submit it to the Store.

Output filenames are `RetroMul-x64.msix` and `RetroMul-x86.msix`; the version is stored inside the package manifest. The package version defaults to the executable's file version. Use `-Version` to set a new four-part Store version with a final component of zero:

```powershell
.\BuildStorePackage.ps1 -Version 1.2.0.0
```

`-Platform Win32` selects the 32-bit build and that platform's project settings; the default is `Win64`. `-Configuration` defaults to `Release`. Missing Store identity settings produce an error; they are not borrowed from a different platform or configuration. Optional `-PackageName`, `-Publisher`, `-PublisherDisplayName`, and `-DisplayName` parameters override project values.

The payload contains the project executable, adjacent DLLs, the build's `Lang` directory if present, and the project's Windows logos. `-InputDirectory` selects another build directory; `-ContentDirectory` adds runtime resources from another directory. Build intermediates and release ZIPs are not copied by default. `-MakeAppxPath` overrides SDK tool discovery, and `-OutputDirectory` overrides the output location. All staging files and evaluated settings remain in `codex-work/build/store-package`.

The unsigned `.msix` is intended for Store submission; local installation requires a separate signing or development deployment step. Packaging success does not replace installation testing or Microsoft Store certification.

To Authenticode-sign the executable before packaging, install a code-signing certificate with its private key in the Windows Personal certificate store, then pass its thumbprint:

```powershell
.\BuildStorePackage.ps1 -SigningCertificateThumbprint '0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF01234567'
```

The script signs and verifies the staged EXE using SignTool and SHA-256, with an RFC 3161 timestamp. The original build executable is preserved. `-SigningCertificateStore LocalMachine` selects the machine's Personal store instead of the current user's store. `-SignToolPath` and `-TimestampUrl` override the SDK tool path and timestamp server. Signing or verification errors stop packaging. The MSIX itself remains unsigned for Store submission. Without `-SigningCertificateThumbprint`, executable signing is skipped.

`CreateRelease.ps1 -Tag v1.0.0` uploads the seven platform ZIPs and `releases/RetroMul-x64.msix` by default. Build the MSIX before creating the release. Use `-StoreArchitectures x86,x64` to include both Windows packages or `-StoreArchitectures @()` to upload only the ZIPs. Missing or empty selected packages stop release creation before contacting GitHub.

## Source layout

| Directory | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/retromul` | Emulator frontend: forms, controllers, settings, virtual devices and platform UI |
| `apps/retrotune` | Music player project and forms |
| `apps/terminal` | Windows console frontend |
| `source/contracts` | Emulation and storage interfaces and shared data types |
| `source/runtime` | Emulator factory, adapters, worker timing and snapshot coordination |
| `source/cores` | System-specific emulation, cartridges, audio machines and firmware |
| `source/hardware` | Shared CPU, audio-chip and video implementations |
| `source/media` | ROM identification, CD access and native CHD decoding |
| `source/services` | Storage, configuration, system catalog and game-list metadata |
| `source/platform` | Host storage integration and performance hints |
| `source/music` | Reusable decoders, trackers, playback, synthesis and export |
| `source/ui/fmx` | Shared FMX controls, SVG rendering and Game & Watch artwork backend |
| `dependencies` | Git submodules: DelphiWinUI3, FMXVibration, FMXInput and PCMAudio |

Initialize dependencies with `git submodule update --init --recursive`. Their repository URLs and pinned commits are unchanged; the logical submodule names in `.gitmodules` are retained so existing Git metadata continues to work. DelphiWinUI3's nested submodules remain part of that dependency. Do not add dependency contents to the parent repository as ordinary files.

## RetroTune

<details>
<summary>RetroTune features, supported music formats, and Delphi integration</summary>

RetroTune is the companion player for retro game music, chiptunes, tracker modules, MIDI / General MIDI, and WAV audio. Its decoder registry and threaded PCM player can also be used in another Delphi application without the RetroTune interface.

- Play NES NSF/NSFe, SNES SPC, Game Boy GBS, Commodore SID, Atari music, VGM/VGZ, and a wide range of Spectrum tracker and chip-dump formats.
- Listen to MSX / Master System KSS, PC Engine HES, Amiga AHX/HVL/MOD, Dreamcast DSF/MiniDSF, TIATracker, TurboSound, TurboFM, IMF/DRO, XGM/XGM2, and digital tracker music.
- Play MIDI with GeneralUser GS, TimGM6mb, FluidR3 GM, or a custom SF2 bank. Switching banks preserves the selected track, position, and playback state.
- Extract supported music from Spectrum TAP and TR-DOS disk containers.
- Select tracks, pause and resume playback, seek, and adjust volume.
- Choose from eleven audio visualizations, including spectrograms, stereo spectra, phase correlation, and RMS/peak meters.
- Inspect file information, track durations, metadata, and the supported-format reference.
- Export a selected track to WAV in the background, with progress and cancellation.
- Use an English or Russian interface. The system language is selected automatically at startup; other languages use English.

See [RetroTune format details](apps/retrotune/FORMATS.md) for supported variants and limitations.

### Supported music formats

The following table lists every extension registered by the RetroTune application. Extensions identify specific supported variants; they do not imply support for every unrelated format that uses the same suffix.

| Format / family | Extensions |

| TFM Music Maker | `.tf0`, `.tfe` |
| TurboFM compiled / register dump | `.tfc`, `.tfd` |
| Multitrack audio container | `.mtc` |
| SAM Coupe E-Tracker / SAA1099 | `.cop`, `.etc`, `.sng` |
| Spectrum tape containing E-Tracker music | `.tap` |
| TR-DOS disk image / SINCLAIR disk archive containing music | `.trd`, `.scl` |
| Chip Tracker | `.chi` |
| Digital Music Maker | `.dmm` |
| Digital Studio | `.dst` |
| SQ Digital Tracker | `.sqd` |

| Extreme Tracker, Extreme / ProDigiTracker raw modules | `.et1`, `.d`, `.m` |
| ProDigiTracker | `.pdt` |
| id Software AdLib IMF, DOSBox RAW OPL | `.imf`, `.dro` |
| Standard MIDI / General MIDI, RIFF MIDI, karaoke audio | `.mid`, `.midi`, `.rmi`, `.kar` |
| RIFF/WAVE PCM / IEEE Float audio | `.wav` |

SID playback supports PSID; RSID is outside the supported variant. IMF uses 700 Hz timing. `.xgc` refers to compiled XGM2. `.sng` refers to raw SAM Coupe E-Tracker modules; `.txt` refers to Vortex Tracker modules. TAP/TRD/SCL are music containers, not general tape/disk program emulators. KAR plays the MIDI audio; lyrics are skipped. WAV supports mono/stereo PCM 8/16/24/32-bit and IEEE Float 32/64-bit, including the corresponding WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE subformats.

MiniDSF needs its referenced library files beside the source file. MD1 needs the companion `.d15` or `.d8` sample bank; `.d8` is a companion file, not a separately registered playable format. MIDI needs a SoundFont2 bank. Standard banks are plain `GeneralUser-GS.sf2`, `TimGM6mb.sf2`, and `FluidR3_GM.sf2` files in the `sf2` directory beside the executable, with their license notices. The Windows RetroTune build prepares that directory automatically. Custom SF2 files can be selected separately; the banks are not embedded in the EXE.

### Using the player in another Delphi application

`TTunePlayer` in `source/music/playback/RetroTune.Player.pas` owns the playback thread and PCM device; it does not depend on FireMonkey or `RetroTune.Main`. Add `source/music/decoders`, `source/music/common`, `source/music/chips`, `source/music/playback`, and `dependencies/PCMAudio` to your project's unit search path. Other decoders can additionally require `source/music/trackers` (including its `amiga` directory), `source/contracts`, `source/runtime`, the relevant `source/hardware` directories and system-specific core directories. The complete decoder set's paths are listed in `apps/retrotune/RetroTune.dproj`.

Decoder units register their formats in their `initialization` sections. This standalone console example enables WAV and MIDI; add the other `RetroTune.Decoder.*` units used by [RetroTune.dpr](apps/retrotune/RetroTune.dpr) to enable their formats. Keep dependent decoder units when using containers. For MIDI, prepare the `sf2` directory beside **your application's** EXE, or call `SetMidiSoundFont` with a custom SF2 path before opening the MIDI file.

The example plays the default track for up to ten seconds, checks asynchronous playback errors, and releases the player even if playback fails:

```pascal
program StandaloneTune;

{$APPTYPE CONSOLE}

uses
  System.SysUtils, System.Classes,
  RetroTune.Decoder, RetroTune.Player,
  RetroTune.Decoder.WAV, RetroTune.Decoder.MIDI;

begin
  try
    if ParamCount <> 1 then
      raise Exception.Create('Usage: StandaloneTune <music.wav|music.mid>');

    // Optional for MIDI: SetMidiSoundFont('C:\Music\MyBank.sf2');
    var Decoder := TTuneDecoders.Open(ParamStr(1));
    var Info := Decoder.GetInfo;
    var Player := TTunePlayer.Create(Decoder);
    try
      Player.SetVolume(80); // 0..100
      Player.SelectTrack(Info.DefaultTrack); // Track indexes start at zero.
      Player.Play;
      var Started := TThread.GetTickCount64;
      repeat
        var State := Player.Status;
        if State.Error <> '' then
          raise Exception.Create(State.Error);
        if State.State = TTunePlayerState.Finished then
          Break;
        TThread.Sleep(20);
      until TThread.GetTickCount64 - Started >= 10000;
      Player.Stop;
    finally
      Player.Free; // Terminates and joins the worker; closes the audio device.
    end;
  except
    on E: Exception do
    begin
      Writeln(E.ClassName, ': ', E.Message);
      ExitCode := 1;
    end;
  end;
end.
```

Run it as `StandaloneTune.exe "C:\Music\song.mid"` or pass a WAV file. `Player.Pause` pauses and `Player.Play` resumes; `Player.Seek(30.0)` requests an asynchronous seek to 30 seconds (`Player.Status.Seeking` reports progress). `SelectTrack` resets the selected track to its beginning. `Status` and the player control methods synchronize access internally. After creating the player, use those methods rather than calling the same decoder's `Render` or `SelectTrack` from another thread. Read metadata before handing the decoder to the player, as above.

Audio output is selected by `PCM.Audio.Factory`: WaveOut on Windows, ALSA on Linux, AudioTrack on Android, and Audio Queue on macOS/iOS. Your own application still needs the normal platform audio setup. No RetroTune forms, `Application.Initialize`, or `Application.Run` are required for the console example.
